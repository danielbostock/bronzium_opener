# <div align="center"> Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes <p>BlueStacks Bronzium Opener</p> </div>


## Requirements

In order to use this application to open up your bronzium packs for you, you will need the following two things setup and basic knowledge on how to use them.

1. Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) account in Google
2. BlueStacks setup and logged in with SWGOH account

## What does this application do?

In summary this application just repatively presses a keyboard key for you. This application will effectively keep pressing the '1' key repeatedly for as long as you define. BlueStacks has game controls which are like hot keys where you can use a key on your keyboard to provide an input to the BlueStacks game you are running.

## Why

If you are lazy like me, pressing the '1' as much as you would have to or clicking through the opening gets tedious and rather boring. There are other things whilst I have the time I would rather be doing. Thus I felt there should be a way to automate this whole process where I can go make dinner and packs can be opening for me while I do this or other things like going for a walk with my family as we so often do.
